# WHO Anemia Guidelines — Key Reference Material

## Definition of Anemia (WHO)
Anemia is defined as a condition in which the number of red blood cells or the hemoglobin concentration within them is lower than normal. Hemoglobin is needed to carry oxygen, and if you have too few or abnormal red blood cells, or not enough hemoglobin, there will be a decreased capacity of the blood to carry oxygen to the body's tissues.

## WHO Hemoglobin Thresholds for Anemia Diagnosis

### Non-pregnant women (age 15+)
- Normal: Hb ≥ 12.0 g/dL
- Mild anemia: Hb 11.0–11.9 g/dL
- Moderate anemia: Hb 8.0–10.9 g/dL
- Severe anemia: Hb < 8.0 g/dL

### Pregnant women
- Normal: Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL
- Mild anemia: Hb 10.0–10.9 g/dL
- Moderate anemia: Hb 7.0–9.9 g/dL
- Severe anemia: Hb < 7.0 g/dL

### Men (age 15+)
- Normal: Hb ≥ 13.0 g/dL
- Mild anemia: Hb 11.0–12.9 g/dL
- Moderate anemia: Hb 8.0–10.9 g/dL
- Severe anemia: Hb < 8.0 g/dL

### Children (age 5–11)
- Normal: Hb ≥ 11.5 g/dL
- Mild anemia: Hb 11.0–11.4 g/dL
- Moderate anemia: Hb 8.0–10.9 g/dL
- Severe anemia: Hb < 8.0 g/dL

### Children (age 6–59 months)
- Normal: Hb ≥ 11.0 g/dL
- Mild anemia: Hb 10.0–10.9 g/dL
- Moderate anemia: Hb 7.0–9.9 g/dL
- Severe anemia: Hb < 7.0 g/dL

## Types of Anemia

### Iron Deficiency Anemia (IDA)
Iron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia worldwide, affecting approximately 1.2 billion people. It occurs when the body lacks sufficient iron to produce adequate hemoglobin. Iron is essential for hemoglobin synthesis — without it, red blood cells become small (microcytic) and pale (hypochromic).

**Causes:**
- Inadequate dietary iron intake
- Poor iron absorption (celiac disease, gastric surgery)
- Increased iron requirements (pregnancy, growth)
- Chronic blood loss (menstruation, GI bleeding)

**Symptoms:**
- Fatigue and weakness
- Pale skin and mucous membranes
- Shortness of breath on exertion
- Dizziness and lightheadedness
- Cold hands and feet
- Brittle nails (koilonychia)
- Pica (craving non-food items like ice, dirt)
- Restless legs syndrome
- Glossitis (swollen, sore tongue)

**Diagnosis:**
- Complete blood count (CBC): low Hb, low MCV, low MCH
- Serum ferritin: < 15 μg/L confirms iron depletion
- Serum iron: decreased
- Total iron-binding capacity (TIBC): increased
- Transferrin saturation: < 16%

**Treatment:**
- Oral iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate 325 mg, 1-3 times daily)
- Dietary modifications (red meat, legumes, fortified cereals)
- Vitamin C supplementation to enhance iron absorption
- IV iron for severe cases or malabsorption
- Treat underlying cause of blood loss

### Vitamin B12 Deficiency Anemia (Megaloblastic)
Caused by insufficient vitamin B12, which is required for DNA synthesis in red blood cell production. Results in large, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts).

**Causes:**
- Pernicious anemia (autoimmune destruction of intrinsic factor)
- Dietary deficiency (strict vegans)
- Malabsorption (Crohn's disease, celiac disease)
- Medications (metformin, proton pump inhibitors)

**Symptoms:**
- Fatigue, weakness
- Glossitis, mouth ulcers
- Neurological symptoms: numbness, tingling, balance problems
- Cognitive changes: memory loss, confusion
- Depression

### Folate Deficiency Anemia
Similar to B12 deficiency but caused by insufficient folate (vitamin B9). Critical during pregnancy for preventing neural tube defects.

**Causes:**
- Poor dietary intake of leafy greens, citrus fruits
- Increased requirements (pregnancy, hemolytic anemia)
- Malabsorption
- Certain medications (methotrexate, phenytoin)

### Anemia of Chronic Disease
Second most common type of anemia. Occurs in patients with chronic infections, inflammatory diseases, or cancer. The body's inflammatory response interferes with iron metabolism and red blood cell production.

### Hemolytic Anemia
Occurs when red blood cells are destroyed faster than they can be produced. Can be inherited (sickle cell disease, thalassemia) or acquired (autoimmune, infections).

### Aplastic Anemia
A rare but serious condition where the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells. Can be caused by autoimmune disorders, toxins, radiation, or certain medications.

## Non-Invasive Anemia Screening Methods

Traditional anemia screening requires blood draws (venipuncture), which is:
- Invasive and painful
- Requires trained phlebotomists
- Not feasible for mass screening in resource-limited settings
- Results take time

### Emerging Non-Invasive Methods:
1. **Conjunctival pallor assessment** — Clinical examination of the inner eyelid
2. **Nail bed analysis** — Using image processing to assess pallor
3. **Smartphone-based screening** — Using phone cameras to capture fingertip images and estimate hemoglobin levels through analysis of skin color and blood flow
4. **Spectrophotometric devices** — Using light absorption to estimate hemoglobin through the skin
5. **AI/ML-based approaches** — Deep learning models trained on clinical images to predict hemoglobin levels without blood draws

### HemaV Approach:
HemaV uses a smartphone camera-based approach combined with machine learning to provide non-invasive hemoglobin estimation and anemia screening. This enables:
- Point-of-care screening without lab equipment
- Rapid results (< 30 seconds)
- Cost-effective mass screening
- Accessible in resource-limited settings

## Global Impact of Anemia

- Anemia affects approximately 1.8 billion people worldwide (WHO 2023)
- Most prevalent in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa
- Women and children are disproportionately affected
- Iron deficiency is the cause in approximately 50% of anemia cases
- Annual economic impact estimated at $18 billion in lost productivity
- Maternal anemia increases risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and maternal mortality
- Childhood anemia impairs cognitive development and school performance

## Treatment Guidelines

### Iron Supplementation (WHO Recommendations):
- Children 6-23 months: 10-12.5 mg elemental iron daily
- Children 24-59 months: 30 mg elemental iron daily
- Children 5-12 years: 30-60 mg elemental iron daily
- Adolescents and adults: 30-60 mg elemental iron daily
- Pregnant women: 30-60 mg elemental iron daily throughout pregnancy

### Dietary Recommendations:
- **Heme iron sources** (highest bioavailability): red meat, poultry, fish, liver
- **Non-heme iron sources**: legumes, dark leafy greens, fortified cereals, tofu
- **Enhancers of iron absorption**: vitamin C, citric acid, meat
- **Inhibitors of iron absorption**: phytates (whole grains), polyphenols (tea, coffee), calcium
